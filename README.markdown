##DOC to TXT##

###About###
DOC to TXT is a simple Applescript application for Mac OS X that converts Microsoft Word files (.doc, .docx) and converts them to a .txt file. For reference or issues, go to the project page (http://mikefrizzell.com/projects/doc-to-txt.html).

###How to run###
To run the app, just doubleclick DOC-to-TXT.app, choose the files you want to convert and select where you would like to save them. Using OS X's built-in textutil script, the .doc or .docx file will be converted to plaintext.

###Limitations###
There are limitations to plaintext, which this script cannot work around. While it will extract headers and footers, sometimes complex formatting is lost in conversion. If you have tables, footnotes, or images, a different converter would be more useful.
